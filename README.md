# 📘 NLP-Processing-NER

## **Student Info**

**Name:** RAJAVAMSHI SAMUDRALA   

**Assignment:** NLP Tokenization, Lemmatization, POS Filtering & Named Entity Recognition (NER)    

---

## 📖 **Problem Statement**

Perform NLP preprocessing and entity extraction on given input texts.

You must implement:

### **Q1. Text Preprocessing**

* Tokenization
* Stopword Removal
* Lemmatization (no stemming)
* Keep only **verbs and nouns** using POS tags

### **Q2. Named Entity Recognition + Pronoun Ambiguity Detection**

* Perform **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
* If the text contains a pronoun:

  * **"he", "she", "they" → print a warning message"**

✔ Note: All code must run **without spaCy** (Python 3.14 incompatible), so the implementation uses **NLTK only**.

## 📝 **Q1 — Text Preprocessing**

### **Input Text**

> *"John enjoys playing football while Mary loves reading books in the library."*

### **Steps Performed**

1️⃣ Tokenized the sentence into word tokens    
2️⃣ Removed English stopwords    
3️⃣ Applied **WordNet lemmatization**     
4️⃣ Filtered tokens to keep only **verbs and nouns**   
5️⃣ Printed final processed tokens

## 📝 **Q2 — NER + Pronoun Ambiguity Detection**

### **Input Text**

> *"Chris met Alex at Apple headquarters in California. He told him about the new iPhone launch."*

### **Steps Performed**

1️⃣ Tokenized the input text      
2️⃣ Applied NLTK **POS tagging**       
3️⃣ Performed **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**     

* PERSON
* ORGANIZATION
* GPE (Location)

4️⃣ Checked for pronouns: **he**, **she**, **they**            
5️⃣ Printed a **warning** message if pronoun ambiguity detected         

---

## 📈 **Results Summary**

### ✔ **Q1 Output**

Only **nouns and verbs** were retained after preprocessing.
The pipeline successfully:

* removed stopwords
* lemmatized tokens
* extracted verbs and nouns

---

### ✔ **Q2 Output**

NER detected the following entities:

| Entity     | Type         |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Chris      | PERSON       |
| Alex       | PERSON       |
| Apple      | ORGANIZATION |
| California | GPE          |

Pronoun **"He"** was detected →
⚠️ **Warning: Possible pronoun ambiguity detected!**
